  "description": "This extension meant for developers and others, who need a clear distinction of the current page host IP. IT allows you to see the host IP of current websites and custom text by adding a colored label to all pages of the site. Good for UIs that look the same on many places, but are actually different sites (like Wordpress, Cpanel and alike ).",
